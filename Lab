# Cyber Engineering Research - Design World Case Study

## Overview

Design World (DW) is a multinational engineering and design firm formed from the merger of three smaller firms. The company specializes in artistic structural support systems. DW faced security challenges, including physical break-ins and hacking incidents resulting in the theft of valuable intellectual property (IP). To address these issues, DW implemented a private enterprise cloud solution with the assistance of USD Cyber Cloud.

## Project Scope

The project aims to secure the international structural design private cloud of Design World. The team will conduct a comprehensive security engineering review, vulnerability assessment, and penetration test to ensure the system's resilience against cyber threats. The project will adhere to assumptions, including a private cloud operated by a US company, virtual Intel-based systems, VPN access control, and remote work environments.
